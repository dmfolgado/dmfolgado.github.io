description: A parallel passion and one of my hobbies

Since I was a kid I always was fascinated by aeroplanes. I ended up earning my private pilot license at Aeroclube de Torres Vedras. I love flying and sharing the magic of this world.
I currently fly the Cessna 150 and Cessna 172 at Santa Cruz aerodrome.
