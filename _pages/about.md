I am a Scientist at Fraunhofer AICOS, Portugal. I received my MSc in Biomedical Engineering from Faculty of Sciences and Technology (FCT NOVA) in 2015. Since then, I have been working in the development of novel methodologies to extract information from time series data. Our goal is the application of these methodologies in the detailed evaluation of Human movement using inertial sensors. My research interests are time series analysis, machine learning, deep neural networks, time series representation and time series visualization.
